# Gamemode_CRPG

hey guys, Dionysus and Dannu's project. hopefully we will go further than I've already gone.

UPDATE: Brick models needed. Dimensions for them are defined in their respective files. Need model for bank, atm, labor comp, etc.
FINISHED MODEL: Terminal Brick. https://skfb.ly/CDst  Description explains the HEX sample requirements.

list of things that need to be done
- when you place a brick, it takes from the players brick value, but when you destroy it, it does not return it
- make a brick buy brick
- we REALLY need models but I have no idea how to model and I don't have any friends that model so...
- GUI
- I need to remake the old trucking system I had
- need to find a good way to make upgradable pickaxes and axes to take away from the grindy feel
- add a working evidence/witness system to the crime system so that you can get away with illegal shit
- update /stats to be easier read and user friendly
- make a complete system for those who do not want to download a client add-on (might not do this)
- make a semi-economy
- detaining and arrest system for police, integrate handcuffs
- fix any bugs, like the serverCmdPlantBrick error, not sure why it happens but i'm sure its an easy fix
- need fourdoor police vehicle, may be able to use one from forums?
- possible RP-like chat. Very thin line on whether I'll do this or not though. (this means stuff like IC and OOC and what not
- /me /my /do /ame, these are all needed. They should not send chat globally, but just around the player in say, a 10 block radius. /ame doesn't send a chat message, but displays an action over the player's head.
- radio sys
- possible dynamic jail time system
- possible admin-permitted jailbreak system. (players can start jailbreak with right amount of cops online and with admin supervision)
- new weapon system. Weapons will be semi-hard to get, but not impossible. To get them, you must have played on the server for 2(?) hours. they can be attained through an arms dealer, if the arms dealer has the materials to make them and the experience to make the type of gun
